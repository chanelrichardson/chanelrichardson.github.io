    <h4>A number of partisan scores, demographic information, and compactness
      metrics comprise a family of ways to quantify the "fairness" of drawn
      districts. These are especially relevant in redistricting litigation. Over
      the past several months, our lab has put together a library that makes the
      calculation of these metrics easier. The library also provides easy to used
      methods to pull census demographic data, change geographies of shapefiles,
      and visuialize maps and metrics. As each of my lab members did, I contributed
       to a number of methods in this library.</h4>

    <h5>While this was a quick work project, it's my favorite! One of our lab
    collaborators is a talented map drawer and he was asked to draw a new map
    for the Jackson, TN city council districts. Jackson, TN has 43% Black
    population and 9 city council districts. With 4 majority Black districts, the
  map would achieve proportionality. However, the map originally proposed for the city council
only had 3 majority Black districts. I analyzed the maps drawn within our lab, and created a
presentation to compare 2 alternative maps to their proposed maps. Bright and early one morning, I
virtually presented these findings. One of the new maps from our lab was accepted on the spot.
Despite not knowing much about Jackson, TN before this project, it felt good to work on
a project that resulted in immediate change. Since then, I've learned a lot more about city councils
and become more involved with my own. </h5>
