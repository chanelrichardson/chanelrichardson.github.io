<p>Chanel Richardson is currently a research analyst and software developer at the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (<a href="https://mggg.org">MGGG</a>) that's part of the Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts University. Chanel's work centers around analysis used in redistricting litigation, data infrastructure development, and researching topics related to redistricting and voting rights. She graduated from Tufts University with her Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering in 2020 and Duke University with her Master of Science in Electrical Engineering in December 2021.

Chanel is still trying to figure out the boundary between learning and doing. Currently, her time is spent consuming information related to tech, data privacy, politics, gaming, and social media. In the near future, she'll start implementing projects related to these topics. She's also an avid reader of science fiction and speculative fiction.

That's all to say, Chanel is still figuring things out, and she's open to the many possibilities ahead of her in life.</p>
